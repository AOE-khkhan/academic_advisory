# Industry recommendations for academic data science programs

[List of authors](authors.md)

As industry data scientists, we are grateful for the growing number of academic programs in the field. It is a challenge to find enough candidates to fill out our teams and solve the problems we face. We welcome new entrants to the field, whether it is their first career or a second, and would like to help them get the best preparation possible.


Several of us have been invited to participate on the advisory boards of academic data science programs, and we want to share our collected insights as a resource to such programs anywhere.
Two of the most common questions are indirectly about how to best prepare students: **What precisely do industry data scientists do?** and **What makes someone a good data scientist?**
We've attempted to answer both of these in a way that can inform how you construct your degree program and your course material.
We address the third most common question as well: **How can we partner with companies?**


## What do data scientists do in our companies?

Data scientists are called by [lots of different names](terminology.md),
but they all have one thing in common: they use data to answer questions to support decisions.
The process of doing this is varied and complex.
There are several roles and families of skills that are necessary.
Successful data scientists have some aptitude across several of these areas
and have particularly strong skills in at least one of them.

Here is one taxonomy of data science roles and a few representative skills for each.


### Data analysis

Data analysis is a the process of turning raw information into knowledge that can be acted on. 
There are several different skill families in this area, and their importance varies widely by domain.

**Research**
Sifting through and organizing information that is already available, but dispersed.

**Statistics**
Several aspects of statistics are useful in interpreting information
Hypothesis testing, A/B testing, significance

**Visualization**




### Data engineering

**Extraction**

**Transformation**

Databases



### Modeling

**Statistics**

**Model selection**

**Feature creation**


### Machine learning

Algorithms

Computational complexity

Optimization


### Software engineering

**Version control**

**Programming**


### Domain expertise

Understanding what is possible, what is reasonable, what is unexpected, what has been tried before and with what results.
Knowing how data is gathered, what it represents, the ways in which it is likely to be misrepresented.

### Communication

In their writing, presentataions and emails
Focus on audience. What they know. What they need to know. What they care about.
Communicating methods and results to a non-technical audience



### Breadth

Don't be afraid to cross roles. A rockstar is someone who drops the mic and walks out. We want an owner--someone who also folds the chairs, mops the bar, and turns off the lights.


### Readiness to learn new tools, skills and domains

Data scientists have to learn new tools with each new position, and sometimes with each new project. There's no practical way to learn all the tools you will need before you need them.
The only way to be prepared for this is get comfortable with the process of learning new tools. 
Don't worry about tools. Wherever a student goes to work, they will have to learn new tools. A smaller set keeps the learning curve shorter, and minimizes the overhead in supporting them. It lets students spend more time learning the underlying skills.


### Learning through practice

The strongest data scientists are those who have a broad understanding of all the roles a data scientist can play and have deep skills in at least one.
In our experience, these data scientists are the ones who have worked on realistic data science problems in several domains.
The skills required to work with data are tough to learn in the abstract. Concrete examples with rich context and ambiguity are powerful teachers. Applying the same skill in several different domains bestows a facility on the learner that is hard to get any other way. 


## How can an academic data science program most effectively partner with a company?

Partnerships between companies and academic data science programs are natural.
Both share a common goal--to help students receive an excellent education in the field of data science.
When this happens it reflects well on the institution and its instructors
and it prepares a new wave of data scientists to do great work in whatever company they land.

There is no single template for a successful partnership. The strengths, needs and resources of each program and company are unique.
Each partnership that evolves is a singular relationship. 
One thing we have observed is that connections between institutions tend to be brokered and sustained by individuals.
Fostering individual connections between faculty and industry data scientists is an effective way to promote partnering.
Here are some examples of how industry and academic programs have worked together in the past. 

### Tech talks

### Research grants

### Sponsoring student organizations

### Mentoring capstone projects

### Providing data and case studies

### Research collaborations and joint publication
