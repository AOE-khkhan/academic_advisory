# Industry recommendations for academic data science programs

[List of authors](authors.md)

As industry data scientists, we are grateful for the growing number of academic programs in the field. It is a challenge to find enough candidates to fill out our teams and solve the problems we face. We welcome new entrants to the field, whether it is their first career or a second, and would like to help them get the best preparation possible.


Several of us have been invited to participate on the advisory boards of academic data science programs, and we want to share our collected insights as a resource to such programs anywhere.
Two of the most common questions are indirectly about how to best prepare students: [**What precisely do industry data scientists do?**](what_ds_do.md) and [**What makes someone a good data scientist?**](strong_DS_skills.md)
We've attempted to answer both of these in a way that can inform how you construct your degree program and your course material.
We address the third most common question as well: **How can we partner with companies?**



## How can an academic data science program most effectively partner with a company?

Partnerships between companies and academic data science programs are natural.
Both share a common goal--to help students receive an excellent education in the field of data science.
When this happens it reflects well on the institution and its instructors
and it prepares a new wave of data scientists to do great work in whatever company they land.

There is no single template for a successful partnership. The strengths, needs and resources of each program and company are unique.
Each partnership that evolves is a singular relationship. 
One thing we have observed is that connections between institutions tend to be brokered and sustained by individuals.
Fostering individual connections between faculty and industry data scientists is an effective way to promote partnering.
Here are some examples of how industry and academic programs have worked together in the past. 

### Tech talks

### Research grants

### Sponsoring student organizations

### Mentoring capstone projects

### Providing data and case studies

### Research collaborations and joint publication


## A work in progress

It is the authors' hope that this serve as a summary of an ongoing conversation.
