## Data scientist job titles

There seems to be no perfectly fitting word for the collection of skills and theory that allows one to extract answers to questions from raw information.
*Data scientist* is the term most commonly applied by the community at large,
but there are others, each suggesting a different emphasis
([credit to this post by Lyft Engineering](https://eng.lyft.com/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c) for most of these):

**applied scientist**,

**applied statistician**,

**business analyst**,

**business intelligence analyst**,

**data analyst**,

**data miner**,

**economist**,

**machine learning engineer**,

**machine learning scientist**,

**operations research scientist**,

**product analyst**,

**product scientist**,

**quantitative analyst**,

**research scientist**,

**research engineer**,

**statistician**.

A note of caution: when interpreting job postings, applicants would know well to look past the title to the tasks and responsibilities of the role. One unfortunate consequence of the lack of consensus around titles is that you can never be certain what a position entails based on the title.
