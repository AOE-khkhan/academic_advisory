## Data science

There seems to be no perfectly fitting word for the collection of skills and theory that allows one to extract answers to questions from raw information. *Data science* is the term most commonly applied by the community at large, but there are others, each suggesting a different emphasis: *analytics*, *business intelligence*, *applied statistics*, *quantitative analysis*, *data mining*. 

*Machine learning* is closely related, but already has a relatively well defined set of tools and community. *Artificial intelligence* is also related, but has several interpretations, and is increasingly used as a synonym for machine learning.
