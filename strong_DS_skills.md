# What skills do exceptional candidates come with?

## Communication

In their writing, presentataions and emails
Focus on audience. What they know. What they need to know. What they care about.
Communicating methods and results to a non-technical audience



## Breadth

Don't be afraid to cross roles. A rockstar is someone who drops the mic and walks out. We want an owner--someone who also folds the chairs, mops the bar, and turns off the lights.


## Readiness to learn new tools, skills and domains

Data scientists have to learn new tools with each new position, and sometimes with each new project. There's no practical way to learn all the tools you will need before you need them.
The only way to be prepared for this is get comfortable with the process of learning new tools. 
Don't worry about tools. Wherever a student goes to work, they will have to learn new tools. A smaller set keeps the learning curve shorter, and minimizes the overhead in supporting them. It lets students spend more time learning the underlying skills.


## Learning through practice

The strongest data scientists are those who have a broad understanding of all the roles a data scientist can play and have deep skills in at least one.
In our experience, these data scientists are the ones who have worked on realistic data science problems in several domains.
The skills required to work with data are tough to learn in the abstract. Concrete examples with rich context and ambiguity are powerful teachers. Applying the same skill in several different domains bestows a facility on the learner that is hard to get any other way.
