# How can an academic data science program most effectively partner with a company?

Partnerships between companies and academic data science programs are natural.
Both share a common goal--to help students receive an excellent education in the field of data science.
When this happens it reflects well on the institution and its instructors
and it prepares a new wave of data scientists to do great work in whatever company they land.

There is no single template for a successful partnership. The strengths, needs and resources of each program and company are unique.
Each partnership that evolves is a singular relationship. 
One thing we have observed is that connections between institutions tend to be brokered and sustained by individuals.
Fostering individual connections between faculty and industry data scientists is an effective way to promote partnering.
Here are some examples of how industry and academic programs have worked together in the past. 

## Tech talks

## Research grants

## Sponsoring student organizations

## Mentoring capstone projects

## Providing data and case studies

## Research collaborations and joint publication
