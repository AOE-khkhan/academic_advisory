# What do data scientists do in our companies?

Data scientists (DS) are called by [lots of different names](terminology.md),
but they all have one thing in common: they use data to answer questions to support decisions.
The process of doing this is varied and complex.
There are several groups of skills necessary.
Successful data scientists have some aptitude across several of these areas
and have particularly strong skills in at least one of them.

Here is a taxonomy of data science skill groups and representative skills for each.


## Analysis

--The process of turning raw information into knowledge that can be acted on. 

### Domain knowledge

A DS that understands the application area deeply can understanding what is possible, what is reasonable, what is unexpected, what has been tried before and with what results.
They know how data is gathered, what it represents, the ways in which it is likely to be misrepresented.
This enables them to **translate a business need to a question** with a quantitative answer.
Their grasp of the big picture helps them understand what is most important when **making accuracy-cost-time trade-offs**. 
Their experience lets them **anticipate how things can fail**, catch effects that were not accounted for, and identify which assumptions are faulty. Then, when the analysis is complete, their domain knowledge helps them **report results** in an audience-appropriate way.

### Research

Even after a problem is defined and a good quantitative question is formulated, **gathering the data** can require quite a bit of work and creativity. It can involve searching through known repostories, interviewing colleagues, delving deeply into documentation, and **sorting through data stores** to identify the relevant portions. If the data doesn't yet exist, research can also involve **designing and conducting experiments** to collect it.

### Interpretation

Statistical reasoning, aggregation, summarization, visualization

Interpreting data and model results to answer the question. Several aspects of statistics are useful in interpreting information

Hypothesis testing, A/B testing, significance



## Modeling

--The process of using the data we have to estimate the data we wish we had.

### Unsupervised learning

Clustering, factor analysis, anomaly detection

### Supervised learning

Classification, regression, time-series prediction

### Custom algorithm development

Feature engineering, Computational complexity, numerical optimization


## Engineering

--The process of making everything else work faster, more robustly, and at greater scale.

### Data management

Database design, pipeline construction, scraping, streaming

### Production

Automation, scaling, system integration, robustification, parallelization

### Software engineering

Version control, scaling, maintainability, optimization, 


## Mechanics

--The mundane skills needed to work with data in any capacity.

### Data Formatting

Type conversion, uniform representation, string manipulation

### Data handling

Querying, slicing, joining, concatenating

### Value interpretation

dates, missing values, redundant labels,
