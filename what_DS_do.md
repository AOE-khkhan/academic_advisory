# What do data scientists do in our companies?

Data scientists are called by [lots of different names](terminology.md),
but they all have one thing in common: they use data to answer questions to support decisions.
The process of doing this is varied and complex.
There are several groups of skills necessary.
Successful data scientists have some aptitude across several of these areas
and have particularly strong skills in at least one of them.

Here is a taxonomy of data science skill groups and representative skills for each.


## Analysis

Analysis is the process of turning raw information into knowledge that can be acted on. 

**Domain knowledge**
Question formulation, evaluation criteria, audience-appropriate reporting

Understanding what is possible, what is reasonable, what is unexpected, what has been tried before and with what results.
Knowing how data is gathered, what it represents, the ways in which it is likely to be misrepresented.

Translating a business need to a question with a quantitative answer
What is most important? Accuracy, cost, time trade-offs.

How can things fail? What did we not account for? What assumptions are faulty? About data and results.

**Research**
Searching, gathering, sorting, sifting

Sifting through and organizing information that is already available, but may be dispersed or difficult to find.

**Interpretation**
Statistical reasoning, aggregation, summarization, visualization

Interpreting data and model results to answer the question. Several aspects of statistics are useful in interpreting information

Hypothesis testing, A/B testing, significance



## Modeling

Modeling is the process of using the data we have to estimate the data we wish we had.

**Unsupervised learning**
Clustering, factor analysis, anomaly detection

**Supervised learning**
Classification, regression, time-series prediction

**Custom algorithm development**
Feature engineering, Computational complexity, numerical optimization


## Engineering

Engineering is making everything else work faster, more robustly, and at greater scale.

**Data management**
Database design, pipeline construction, scraping, streaming

**Production**
Automation, scaling, system integration, robustification, parallelization

**Software engineering**
Version control, scaling, maintainability, optimization, 


## Mechanics

Mechanics are the foundational skills needed to navigate 

**Data Formatting**
Type conversion, uniform representation, string manipulation

**Data handling**
Querying, slicing, joining, concatenating

**Value interpretation**
dates, missing values, redundant labels,
