# What do data scientists do in our companies?

Data scientists are called by [lots of different names](terminology.md),
but they all have one thing in common: they use data to answer questions to support decisions.
The process of doing this is varied and complex.
There are several roles and families of skills that are necessary.
Successful data scientists have some aptitude across several of these areas
and have particularly strong skills in at least one of them.

Here is one taxonomy of data science roles and a few representative skills for each.


## Data analysis

Data analysis is a the process of turning raw information into knowledge that can be acted on. 
There are several different skill families in this area, and their importance varies widely by domain.

**Research**
Sifting through and organizing information that is already available, but dispersed.

**Statistics**
Several aspects of statistics are useful in interpreting information
Hypothesis testing, A/B testing, significance

**Visualization**




## Data engineering

**Extraction**

**Transformation**

Databases



## Modeling

**Statistics**

**Model selection**

**Feature creation**


## Machine learning

Algorithms

Computational complexity

Optimization


## Software engineering

**Version control**

**Programming**


## Domain expertise

Understanding what is possible, what is reasonable, what is unexpected, what has been tried before and with what results.
Knowing how data is gathered, what it represents, the ways in which it is likely to be misrepresented.
